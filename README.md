# Did the start of the 'Avocados from Mexico' campaigns cause an increase in Mexican avocado exports? 

## A causal inference project

Mexico is currently the world's biggest avocado exporter with 2.65 million metric tons in 2023, with 81% of the total exports directed to the United States alone. But these numbers have not always been so high, between 2014 and 2021 the total volume of avocados exported to the US doubled. During this period the Association of Avocado Exporting Producers and Packers of Mexico (APEAM) and the Mexican Hass Avocado Importers Association (MHAIA created a company called 'Avocados from Mexico', a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting a brand for Mexican avocados and growing the demand ofavocadost throughout the US.

Together, these observations led to the question: *Did the start of the 'Avocados from Mexico' campaigns cause an increase in Mexico's avocado exports?*

This question cannot be answered through experimentation, as it is impossible to experiment with the global market economic forces in the global avocado trade. However, a causal inference method (**Regression Discontinuity Design**) allows observational data to be used to determine whether the campaigns caused an increase in Mexican avocado exports.
